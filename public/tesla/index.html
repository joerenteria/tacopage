                    When Tesla first showed the Semi in November 2017, many critics doubted that the all-electric Class 8 heavy-duty truck could stick to the payload estimates when reaching production stage.

Fast forward to 2021, and it appears that the Tesla Semiâ€™s payload will be comparable to a Class 8 diesel truck, according to the companyâ€™s Impact Report 2020.

There are two main reasons for that: Tesla has made significant advancements in battery technology since 2017, and US and EU regulators have since approved higher weight allowances for heavy-duty electric trucks.

Starting with the latter, Teslaâ€™s Impact Report 2020 states that in the European Union, electric semi trucks are allowed to be 2 tonnes (4,400 lbs) heavier than diesel equivalents, while in the US the allowance is 0.9 tonnes (2,000 lbs).

                    Among the more affordable options in the electric-vehicle marketplace, the 2021 Tesla Model 3 is, without doubt, the one with the most name recognition. It also earns a spot on our Editors' Choice list. It borrows some styling cues from the company's Model S sedan and Model X SUV, but goes its own way with a unique interior design and an all-glass roof. Acceleration is quick, and the Model 3's chassis is playful as wellâ€”especially the Performance model's, which receives a sportier suspension and a track driving mode. But EV buyers are more likely interested in driving range than speediness or handling, and the Model 3 delivers there too. The base model offers up to 263 miles of driving range according to the EPA, and the more expensive Long Range model can go up to 353 per charge.

                    Remember back to November 2017? Between all the natural disasters, political upheaval, and an ongoing global pandemic, it seems like a lifetime ago. But on November 17, 2017, following the reveal of Tesla's semi truck, Elon Musk surprised the world by debuting the next-generation Tesla Roadster.

2020 was its targeted production date but that obviously came and went. Elon Musk mentioned 2022 as a new target early this year, but it appears even Tesla isn't immune to the COVID pandemic, semiconductor shortage, and all the havoc these situations are causing. In a fresh Twitter post, Musk eyes 2023 as when the new Roadster will ship. That is, provided "2022 is not mega drama."
